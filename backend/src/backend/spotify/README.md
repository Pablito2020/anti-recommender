# Spotify App Module

This module could function as a standalone library. It provides the ability to add email addresses to your Spotify app via the API.

The functionality was developed through reverse-engineering the Spotify Developer webpage.

We didn't build a python wheel package because we don't want to maintain it. It will live as long as this project does.
